    <h1 class="h2">Ocean Fishing</h1>

    <p>
      If want to get into fishing and don't have the patience for the regular chasing of fishing nodes,
      ocean fishing is for you.  Ocean fishing is great for both leveling and farming gatherer's
      scrips. To unlock Ocean Fishing, find Fhilsnoe (x7.8, y14.5) at Limsa Lominsa Lower Decks and
      finish the short quest called 'All the Fish in the Sea' available at level 1 after obtaining
      the Fisher Class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ships depart regularly from the Ferry Docks at Limsa Lominsa Lower Decks every two hours.
      Find Dryskthota (x3.0, y12.7) to check when the next ship is leaving and register with
      them when the ship is about to depart.  
    </p>  
    <p>
      There is also a Merchant &amp; Mender (x3.2, y12.8) who sells the standard bait for your
      trip to the sea.  Buy a stack or more of the bait and you're good to go. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Know that there is a bonus only available when you are in a party, so if you want to
      get that bonus, be sure to join the trip with a friend or two.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h3">Strategy and Baits</h2>
    <p>
      You will be going to 3 random destinations on your trip and each area has different fish. 
      This means you need to be careful which bait you use at which location. Here is a list of
      locations and bait to start off with in each location.
    </p>

    <table class="location-baits">
      <tr>
        <th>Location</th>
        <th>Preferred Bait</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Gladion Bay</td>
        <td>Plump Worm</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Rhotano Sea</td>
        <td>Plump Worm</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Northern Strait</td>
        <td>Ragworm</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Southern Strait</td>
        <td>Krill</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Once the Spectral rainbow event appears (it is triggered on an RNG by one person on the
        boat fishing up a spectral fish), switch your bait to Plump Worm to get the best score.
